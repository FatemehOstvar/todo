# FastAPI To-Do Application

This repository contains a simple web API for managing to-do items. The application is built using FastAPI, with PostgreSQL as the database engine. It is containerized with Docker and includes automated testing and continuous integration via GitHub Actions.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the following:

- A minimal REST API for CRUD operations on to-do tasks
- Use of FastAPI for building modern Python web applications
- Integration with PostgreSQL using environment-based configuration
- Docker-based setup for portability and reproducibility
- CI pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated testing and Docker image builds

## Architecture

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Continuous Integration Workflow

GitHub Actions is used to automate the development workflow. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

### Workflow Process:
- Triggered on `push`, `pull_request`, or manual dispatch
- Spins up a PostgreSQL service container
- Installs Python and project dependencies
- Runs unit tests using `pytest`
- Builds the Docker image

To run the workflow manually:
- Navigate to **GitHub → Actions → CI → Run workflow**


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.11 (optional, for local testing outside of containers)
